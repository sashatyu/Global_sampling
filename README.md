This is a project providing the code and input data examples for various global sampling options from the following publication: Tyukavina et al. (2025) "Practical global sampling methods for estimating area and map accuracy of land cover and change classes" [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2025.114714](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2025.114714). For a detailed description of the study please refer to the publicaiton.

**Examples of input data:**

***Sampling design information***
[Number of appendix]Strata_info.txt (for Appendices A.1.1, A.1.2, B.2 and C)

   Columns: 
   * "Stratum": Stratum ID (1-N);
   * (N/A for C, not required for A.1.2) "Count": total number of units (pixels, polygons) in each stratum;
   * (optional for B.2) "Area": Stratum area;
   * (for B.2 only) "Xh": stratum-specific mean of the values of auxiliary class (calculated accross all units in the stratum).
 
   Section B.1 requires the following parameters specified directly in the code:
	* "N": total number of units in the sampling region (population);
	* "X": population mean of the values of auxiliary class (calculated accross all units in the sampling region);
	* (optional, might be needed to convert estimates to % of total area)"Atot" - area of the sampling region (e.g. in kmÂ²).

***Input data for each sample unit***
[Number of appendix]Sample_data.txt (for Appendices A.1.1, A.1.2, B.1, B.2 and C)

   Columns for Appendix A:
   * "Stratum": stratum ID, 1 - nstrata;
   * "Pixarea": area of each sample unit (in units that are desired for area reporting);
   * "Map"(for accuracy assessment only): proportion of target class from the map (0-1) for each sample unit;
   * "Reference": proportion of target class from reference sample classification for each sample unit; allowed values are from -1 to 1 for area estimation, and from 0 to 1 for map accuracy assessment;
   * (optional)"RefType": type labels, if the are of target class needs to be estimated separately for multiple sub-types;
   * (optional)"Correct": proportion of sample unit (0-1), which is correctly mapped. This column is necessary for maps with more than two classes. For map with two classes it is computed in the function "estimate_OA_two_classes" directly from "Map" and "Reference" columns.

   Columns for Appendix B:
   * (for B.2 only)"Stratum": Stratum ID (1-N);
   * "yi": area of the target class in sample unit i,derived from sample interpretation (reference classification); should be in the same units as stratum Area and Atot;
   * "xi": value of the auxiliary class for sample unit (e.g. area of land cover class from existing wall-to-wall map or mean spectral index value within sample unit); ould be in any units matching X.

   Columns for Appendix C:
   * "Stratum": stratum ID, 1 - nstrata;
   * "Reference": proportion of target class from reference sample classification for each sample unit; allowed values are from -1 to 1 for area estimation, and from 0 to 1 for map accuracy assessment;
   * (optional)"RefType": type labels, if the are of target class needs to be estimated separately for multiple sub-types.
